# Release v0.1.6

## Changes

Globbing support has been added to the hyprland source option!

Previously, you could only specify direct relative file paths. Now, you can use globbing patterns—meaning you can use things like ~/ to expand to your home directory and /* to match all files in a directory. The app will automatically find all files matching those patterns when setting the hyprland source.

Please update and try out the new globbing features!
